Refactoring Code

Overview:
This repository contains the refactored code based on the initial task provided. 
I have implemented several improvements in the existing code to make it more maintainable, readable, and scalable. 
These improvements include adhering to best practices, improving error handling, separating concerns, and ensuring that the logic is properly distributed across different layers.

Improvements
1. Service Layer Pattern
Why: To enhance maintainability and scalability, I have introduced a Service Layer pattern.
What was done: I moved the business logic from the controller to dedicated service classes. The controller now delegates all database operations to the service and repository layers. This ensures that the controller remains lightweight and only focuses on processing requests and responses.
Benefit: The code becomes more modular, and the controller is easier to test.
2. Error Handling: Added Try-Catch Blocks
Why: Error handling is crucial for ensuring that the application gracefully handles unexpected issues during execution.
What was done: I have added try-catch blocks in the service layer to catch any exceptions during business logic execution and handle errors appropriately. This ensures that any issues are properly logged and that the system fails gracefully.
Benefit: Improves the stability and reliability of the application by preventing the app from crashing unexpectedly.
3.Request Validation Using Form Requests
Why: To keep validation logic organized and reusable, it's better to use dedicated Form Request classes.
What Was Done: Moved validation rules from the controller to request classes in the Requests folder, making the validation process cleaner and more maintainable.
Benefit: Enhances code readability, reusability, and separation of concerns. Validation logic is now easily testable and can be reused across multiple methods.
4. Maximized Dependency Injection
Why: Dependency Injection (DI) improves flexibility, testability, and maintainability. By injecting dependencies (services, repositories) into controllers and services, we avoid hardcoded dependencies and allow for easier mocking and testing.
What was done: I used dependency injection to pass services and repositories into the controller and service classes.
Benefit: This makes the code easier to test, as we can now mock dependencies easily in unit tests.
5. Using Configs Instead of Direct Env Values
Why: Using environment variables directly throughout the code can lead to inconsistencies and difficulties in managing them across different sensitive data.
What was done: I moved all environment-specific values (like CUSTOMER_ROLE_ID) to a config file (config/usertype.php), which can be easily managed and accessed using Laravel's config() helper.
Benefit: This makes the code more consistent and easier to maintain.
6. Refactoring Complex Functions into Chunks
Why: Complex functions can be hard to understand and test. Breaking them down into smaller chunks helps with readability, usability, and maintainability.
What was done: I divided functions that had complex logic into smaller functions with clear, focused responsibilities. This ensures that each function is easier to test, understand, and reuse.
Benefit: Improves readability and maintainability, making the code easier to extend or modify.

Code Refactor Process

Initial Review: I began by reviewing the original code for maintainability and readability.

Identifying Areas of Improvement: I looked for areas where code could be modularized, functions could be simplified, and dependencies could be injected.

Refactor Process:

Moved business logic from controllers to service classes.
Extracted database queries to repositories to centralize database logic.
Ensured proper error handling with try-catch blocks.
Refactored large functions into smaller, more manageable methods.

Testing

TeHelper: willExpireAt Method
I wrote tests to check the edge cases for the willExpireAt function and verify that the method correctly calculates expiration times based on different inputs.
UserRepository: createOrUpdate Method
I created tests to verify that the createOrUpdate method works correctly, both when creating new users and updating existing users.

Conclusion
The refactor follows clean code principles and makes the application more maintainable, testable, and scalable. 
The main improvements are the application of the service-repository pattern, separation of concerns, error handling, and making the codebase more modular and reusable.
